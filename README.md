CNN-Based Image Classification (Real vs. Fake Images)
• Designed and trained 6 CNN models using TensorFlow and Keras to classify 140K images from Kaggle (70K
real, 70K fake).
• Achieved 94% training accuracy and 88% testing accuracy through hyperparameter tuning and regularization.
• Applied dropout, batch normalization, and model variation to enhance performance and reduce overfitting
